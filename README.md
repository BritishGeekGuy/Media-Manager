# Simple Media Manager (Ver. 1.0.0)

Simple Media Manager is a cross-platform application designed to simplify the management of physical media.
Currently, it has the ability to store CDs and Vinyls however I may expand this in the future.
It is my first "big" project of sorts as well.

## Current Features
- Storing CDs/Vinyl Records in an easy-to-manage database.
- Ability to add cover art from a local source.
- Dark/Light themes (Dark Theme is default.)
- Ability to export database as CSV file.
- Filter by Format or Genre or search for a specific Title/Artist.

## (Currently) Planned Features
- Android App in Flutter (To be used standalone/as a companion)
- Pulling metadata from the internet.
- Ability to scan barcodes to instantly add to database (Android App Only?)
- Possibly replacing the Python client with an application made using the Android App Flutter Codebase.

## Non-Standard Libraries Used

## Created with Python 3.14
